# DogPal
What kind of dog is that? This will let you find out!
This project builds an adorable visual interface and a classification algorithm for dog species classification.

### Project Guidelines



1. Download the dog dataset [dog dataset] (link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip it and place it in `. /dog-project/dogImages`.

2. Download the dog classification VGG-16 network bottleneck feature dataset (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) .  Place it at `. /dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

3. Configure the environment in Python > 3.7, pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

4. run run_rout.py, wait for initialisation to complete, open http://127.0.0.1:5000

5. Run dog_train to train the model.

6. Remind that we store the model by conversions to TFLite
